Post Away 3.0
=========

This is a posting page (sort of social media) that now uses PHP and MySQL. It pushes and receives data from 
the database. It now also uses a login system.

The host for PostAway (koding.com) shuts down servers after 15 minutes of inactivity; we are trying to move it to AWS. You might be able to catch a glimpse if I'm online at the time: http://www.post-away.tk.
